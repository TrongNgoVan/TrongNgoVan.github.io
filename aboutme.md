I recently started a PhD in machine/deep learning at the [Institut of Bioinformatics](http://www.bioinf.jku.at/) of the Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria in the team of Sepp Hochreiter.
Previously I worked at the Institute of Water Management, Hydrology and Hydraulic Engineering at the BOKU University in Vienna, as a research assistant. I did my Master in environmental engineering ant the topic of my Master thesis was the development of a software as part of a semi-automatic monitoring system for fish migration in fish passes. The thesis can be found [here](http://permalink.obvsg.at/bok/AC13359496) (in German only). In my time as research assistant at the BOKU university I mostly worked on machine learning applications in the field of hydrology and environmental sciences.
